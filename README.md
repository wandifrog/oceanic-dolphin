# Oceanic Dolphin

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/wandifrog/oceanic-dolphin.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd oceanic-dolphin
    ```

3. Install project dependencies:

    If you use npm:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    If you use yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

### Running the App

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the development server:
```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. You can view your app at **http://localhost:3000**.

# The next todo
Migrate this old CRA to Vite and Bun runtime, complete the UT using Bun test runner / Vitest (for speedup pipelines, impact to cost efficiency). and dockerize again using the [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/) image.

## Foot notes (a.k.a features)
- Rare structure code (one-level root directory)
